\begin{document}
\maketitle	
	We are grateful to the referee for the helpful comments.
	We have incorporated almost all the comments made by the referee.
	Here are the specific changes in response to the comments of the referee.
\\
\begin{itemize}
\item
	General comments: On the other hand, this proof has a weakness relative to the L-P-P proof: it does not show that $n P(Z_n > 0)$ converges, and uses that fact.
	Maybe there is a way to deduce it from the analysis here, but I did not see it.
	
	{\it 
  The two spine decomposition is built only for the Yaglom's theorem.
	In the revised version, we added a paragraph at the beginning of Section 1.2 related to this.
   At the beginning of Section 3, see p.11,  we added an elementary proof of $n P(Z_n > 0) \xrightarrow[n\to \infty]{} 2/ \sigma^2$.
  }
\\	
\item[1.]
	pp2, first paragraph: ``random element" should be ``random variable" (twice).
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\	
\item[2.]
	pp2, 3 lines from the end, ``followed-up paper" should be ``follow-up paper" (also at the bottom of pp5).
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[3.]
	pp3, line 3: delete ``on the exponential convergence".
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[4.]
	pp4, just after (1.5): To deduce the result from your heuristic, you seem to be assuming that looking at $\ddot Y$ is equivalent, or at least similar, to looking at the conditioned process.
	Why is that true?
	Is there any heuristic reason why this biasing should be similar to conditioning to survive?
	
	{\it 
	Our previous heuristic is not very clear. We revised the heuristic in the new version,  see p.5, after (1.9).}
\\
\item[5.]
	pp4, ``It would be interesting to compare" should be ``It is interesting to compare".
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[6.]
	pp7, line 7, I think $C_u$ should be $\dot C_u$ here, twice.
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[7.]
	pp8, proof of Thm 1.2, the first paragraph could be reduced to ``Note that $\{(X_m(t))_{0 \leq m \leq n}; G_n\} =^d (Z_m)_{0 \leq m \leq n}$ and $\{(X_m(t))_{0\leq m \leq n}; \dot G_n\} =^d (\ddot Z_n)_{0 \leq m \leq n}$." There is no need for so much detail.
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\	
\item[8.]
	pp8, halfway down, "Using this analysis, one can verify that" should be "Using this analysis, we verify that".
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[9.]
	pp9, first display, there is no `` $d$ " required here, this is a discrete space, you can just write `` $\frac{\ddot G_n(t)}{G_n(t)}$ ".
	{\it We agree.
		There is no `` $d$ " required here.
		We simply deleted this display, because if we drop
		``$d$", it becomes (2.3).}
\\
\item[10.]
	pp9, end of proof of Thm 1.2, the QED symbol should be after (2.5).
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[11.]
	pp9, start of section 2.2, ``notations" should be ``notation" (notation is a continuum, like water). Also change ``give the precise meaning that (1.5) admits a size-biased add-on structure for the size-biased $\mu$-Galton-Watson tree" to ``give a precise meaning to (1.5)".
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\	
\item[12.]
	pp9, Proof of Prop 2.1, this is again a bit over-elaborate at the start.
	Could write simply ``For any particle $u = u_1\dots u_n$", write $[\emptyset, u]:= \{u_1\dots u_j: j = 0,\dots, n\}$.
	The particles in $\dot T$ can be separated according to their nearest spin ancestor; we write
\[
	\dot A_k = \{ u \in \dot T: |[\emptyset, u] \cap \dot V| = k\}.
\]
	Then
\[
	X_n(\dot T) = \sum_{k=0}^n X_n(\dot A_k). "
\]
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\	
\item[13.]
	pp10, top: Change ``For convention" to ``and", also change ``transform" to ``transforms".
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[14.]
	pp10, paragraph after (2.7), $\ddot V' - \ddot V\cap \ddot V'$ should be $\ddot V'\setminus \ddot V$, and also ``is separated" should be ``can be separated".
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item [15.]
	pp10, again the discussion before (2.8) can be shortened in the same way as at the start of the proof.
	{\it Changed as suggested.}	
\\
\item [16.]
	pp10, (2.9): Not sure I see the second equality.
	I think the last $E[e^{- \lambda \dot Z_m}]$ should be $E[e^{- \lambda \dot Z_{n-m}}]$.
	What am I missing?
	Even if I'm right, this doesn't seem to cause major problems, but it does need to be chased through the rest of the document.
	{\it We think this equality is correct.
	In the revised version, at the bottom of p.10, we added 
one line
to demonstrate this.}
\\
\item [17.]
	pp11, top, delete ``The proof is complete."
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item [18.]
	pp11, halfway down, after ``Therefore" add ``since $x - \ln x$ is decreasing on $[0,1]$."
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item [19.]
	pp11, bottom, change ``By dividing $\|F\|_\infty$ on the both side of $(3.1)$" to ``By dividing both sides of $(3.1)$ by $\|F\|_\infty$.
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item [20.]
	pp11/12, Proof of Lemma 3.2, you can take $k = 0$ as the base case here, which is trivial.
	Then your proof is shorter.
	{\it
	In the revised version, at bottom of p.12, we gave a new proof to Lemma 3.2, which is much better and much shorter. }
\\
\item [21.]
	pp12, halfway, change ``verify that, $e$ also satisfies" to ``verify that $e$ satisfies".
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[22.]
	pp12, end of proof of Lemma 1.3, you cite [1, Lemma 2.6], but this is a five-year-old preprint that does not appear to have been peer-reviewed.
	Please provide a better reference that has been peer-reviewed.
	
	{\it 
We deleted this reference and added a simple proof of the fact there.	
	}
\\
\item [23.]
	pp13, first display, there should be a dot on $Z_{\lfloor un \rfloor}$.
	{\it Changed as suggested.}		
\end{itemize}
