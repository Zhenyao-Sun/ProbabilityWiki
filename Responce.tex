\begin{document}
\maketitle	
	We are grateful to the referee for the helpful comments.
	%We have incorporated almost all the comments made by the referee.
    We have incorporated all the comments made by the referee (all changed as suggested).
	Here are the specific changes in response to the comments of the referee.
   \\
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.]
	pp3, second paragraph: you later use $\dot L$  and don't define it.
	Replace ``Denote by $\ddot L$ an $L(L-1)$-transform of $L$¡± with ``Denote by $\dot L$ an $L$-transform of $L$, and by $\ddot L$ an $L(L-1)$-transform of $L$.¡±
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item [2.]
	pp4, lines 1+2, ``with $E[X] \in (0, \infty)$, then" should be ``with $E[X] \in (0, \infty)$. Then".
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item [3.]
	pp6, line 1: ``implies" should be ``imply".
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[4.]
	pp6, line 2: ``used in Geiger [3]" should be ``used by Geiger [3]" or ``used in [3]".
%	{\it We changed it into ``used is [3]", as suggested.}
{\it We changed to ``used in [3]", as suggested.}
\\
\item[5.]
	pp6, line 3: ``Due to similar reasons" should be ``For similar reasons".
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[6.]
	pp6, line 7: ``$(0, \infty)$, then" should be ``$(0, \infty)$; then".
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[7.]
	pp9, (2.5): %Use qedhere 
  Use
  
   $\backslash$qedhere 
   
to get the QED mark on the same line as the last display.
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[8.]
	pp9, Prop 2.1: ``Then, we have" should just be ``Then".
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[9.]
	pp11, top: ``descendant of $j$th particle" should be ``descendant of the $j$th particle".
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[10.]
	pp11, middle: ``implies that $q_n \uparrow 1$ while $n \to \infty$" -- it would be more standard to write ``implies that $q_n \uparrow 1$ as $n \to \infty$".
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[11.]
	pp11: ``Now combining (3.1) with above" should be ``Now combining (3.1) with the above".
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\newpage
\item[12.]
	pp11, end of proof of Thm 1.1(1): Maybe align the $\xrightarrow[]{}$ with the last equals sign on the line above, and again use qedhere to get the QED mark in the right place.
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
\\
\item[13.]
	pp12, just after (3.3): ``Then, for each $\lambda > 0$" should be ``Then, for each $\lambda \geq 0$" (you need to take $\lambda = 0$ to get the claim at $\rho$).
	{\it Changed as suggested.}
